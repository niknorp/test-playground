    Today I understood how to use Grid in this project,<br>
    Also I deal with matching and interconnection between files.

    Next step - setup of Grid,<br> creation of new post (blog-item) and implementation of this into project.

    Also I'm very interested why tag "p/" <span>"crashed"</span> all page.
